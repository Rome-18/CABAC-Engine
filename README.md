# CABAC-Engine
Basic CABAC (Context Based Binary Arithmetic Coding) encoer for general use

This project takes input binary data (image, text, audio etc.), reads the data bit by bit and encodes the data using 
Context Adaptive Binary Coding.

It can also do some bitmap preprocessing on the input file to make the data more amenable to compression.

To execute this file, simply run encode.exe -f *.* for input file and decode.exe for -f input output. For more help please use -help.
